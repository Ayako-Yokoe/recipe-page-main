## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to properly align the bullet points and numbers in lists, along with the long texts associated with each list item.

```css
ul,
ol {
  list-style-position: outside;
  padding-left: 10px;
  margin: 0;
}
ul li,
ol li {
  font-family: var(--font-family-secondary);
  line-height: 1.5;
  margin-bottom: 8px;
  margin-left: 20px;
  padding-left: 20px;
}
```

### Continued development

This time, I applied a mobile-first strategy. I'm aiming to become more comfortable with this approach as I continue developing apps.
